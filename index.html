						The Border Collie is a working and herding dog breed developed in the Scottish borders for herding livestock, especially sheep.[1] It was specifically bred for intelligence and obedience. It is very fetch-oriented.

                        Considered highly intelligent, extremely energetic, acrobatic and athletic, they frequently compete with great success in sheepdog trials and dog sports. They are often cited as the most intelligent of all domestic dogs.[2] Border collies continue to be employed in their traditional work of herding livestock throughout the world and are kept as pets.
